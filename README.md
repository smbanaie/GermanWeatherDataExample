# GermanWeatherDataExample #

## Project ##

Going through a lot of pain has taught me, that you have to know about the capabilities and pitfalls of a technology, before putting it in production. These days it's all about "Big Data", but how well do technologies work when we actually throw realistic data at it? What knobs have to be turned to make the technologies scale? How far does a single machine take us?

In the project I want to benchmark [TimescaleDB], [Elasticsearch], [SQL Server] and [InfluxDB] on the 10 Minute Weather Data for Germany.

## Dataset ##

The [DWD Open Data] portal of the [Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)] gives access to the historical weather data in Germany. I decided to analyze the available historical Air Temperature data for Germany given in a 10 minute resolution ([FTP](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/10_minutes/air_temperature/historical/)). If you want to recreate the example, you can find the list of files here: [GermanWeatherDataExample/Resources/files.md](https://github.com/bytefish/GermanWeatherDataExample/blob/master/GermanWeatherData/Resources/files.md).

The DWD dataset is given as CSV files and has a size of approximately 25.5 GB.

## Status ##

### TimescaleDB ###

TimescaleDB was able to import the entire dataset. The final database has ``406241469`` measurements and has a file size 
of ``37 GB``. Nothing had been changed in the TimeseriesDB configuration. More Queries and Performance analysis to follow!

### InfluxDB ###

InfluxDB was able to import the entire dataset. The final database has ``398704931`` measurements and has a file size 
of 7.91 GB. Please read below on the configuration changes necessary to make InfluxDB ingest the dataset. The difference 
between the number of measurements for InfluxDB and TimeseriesDB will be part of further investigation.

InfluxDB 1.7.1 without any configuration is unable to import the entire dataset. It consumes too much RAM under load and 
could not write the batches anymore. After reading through documentation I am quite confident, that the Retention Policy 
has to be adjusted, so that the shards do not stay in memory forever: 

* https://www.influxdata.com/blog/tldr-influxdb-tech-tips-march-16-2017/
* https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/guides/hardware_sizing/

It's because the default configuration of InfluxDB is optimized for realtime data with a short [retention duration] and a 
short [shard duration]. This makes InfluxDB chewing up the entire RAM, just because too many shards are created and the 
cached data is never written to disk actually.

So I am now creating the database using ``DURATION`` set to infinite (``inf``), to keep measurements forever. The 
``SHARD DURATION`` is set to 4 weeks for limiting the number of shards being created during the import:

```
CREATE DATABASE "weather_data" WITH DURATION inf REPLICATION 1 SHARD DURATION 4w NAME "weather_data_policy"
```

In the ``influxdb.conf`` I am setting the ``cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration`` to 5 seconds for flushing the caches more 
agressively:

```
cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration = "5s"
```
